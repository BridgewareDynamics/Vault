stderr | src/components/ImageViewer.test.tsx > ImageViewer > should toggle zoom when image is clicked
Warning: An update to ImageViewer inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at

Warning: React does not recognize the `whileHover` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in 
the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `whilehover` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent 
component, remove it from the DOM element.

If you need to partially mock a module, you can use "importOriginal" helper inside:

  const actual = await importOriginal()
  return {
